Attached here are current assumptions that have been taken to simplify the homework, along with approaches
to handle them in the case of violations.

All names are unique
	Violations: Multiple users with same name
	Solution: Displaying Visitor ID with name would help prevent this particular issue. 

Single doctor:
	Violations: Multiple Doctors
	Solution: Joint visitor -> doctor channel, response includes doctor-id to return patient to

Local service with stable, low-latency network
	Violations: High latency, occasional outages
	Solutions:
		Automated reconnection
		Explicit loading for the various panel commands

Visitors are stateless (Each visitor will only see the doctor once)
	Violations: Medical history
	Solutions:
		Restructuring of models to allow for tracked visits
		Force Usage of Visitor ID if any present
		Time-series display of patient medical history

Patient descriptions are immutable 
	Violations: Descriptions can be editted to clarify conditioon
	Solution: Implement feature allowing Editing and update of the patient information.

Doctor assumed not to make mistakes in see-next
	Violations: Accidential clicks are to be expected
	Solutions:
		Undo previous send
		Timeline of n-most-recently-seen patients and undo functionality for each.
